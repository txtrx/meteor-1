If you would like to run the code locally a few things will have to be installed on your PC

First you will need to install meteor

Then several meteor modules will have to be installed including iron router, angular-JS, node-cron, and twilio

Once these are installed you should be able to run the meteor command in the directory and see the webpage in localhost. 

MongoDB will not have the updated commands. You will have to manually import the data if you want your localhost to resemble the online version.
